# Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock 

Game of Rock 🗿, Paper 📃, Scissors ✂️, Lizard 🦎, Spock 🖖. 

The player is prompted to choose what is going to play.
A random play is generated to play against the player and the winner is displayed.

The player is prompted to play again:

__Y__ -> Game starts again. 

__N__ -> A random sentence of how coward the player was is displayed.

In this project I had the opportunity to practice OOP, to use the Enum class and also to learn about the implementation of dunder methods such as ___eq___ and ___hash___.
